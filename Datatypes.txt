                                    DATA TYPE                 

Definition:
             1)Data types are types of data that is used to store in variable.
             2)In Js Data types are classified into two types,
             3)They are,    
                            *Primitive
                            *Non Primitive




Primitive:
            *Primitive data types are known as immutable .
            *Immutable means a value that can’t be change, Once a value is allocated.
            *Primitive data types are used to store a single value like numbers, boolean ..,etc
            *Primitive data types are classified into 7 types,
            *They are,
                *Number
                *BigInt
                *String 
                *Boolean
                *Undefined
                *Symbol
                *Null

    Number:
            *It’s used to represents a numeric values with or without decimals like float values.
            *Example: let age = 22; 
                      let pi = 3.14;  

    BigInt:
	        *It’s used to represents a numeric value larger than the range of a `Number`.
	        *Numbers have only the eight digit long like 12345678. So above eight digit numbers are stored using BigInt like Aadhar number or mobile number.
	        * Example: let big = 123456789012345678;

    String:
	        *It’s used to represents a series of characters and is written with Double quotes or Single 
            Quotes.
            * Example: let name="santhosh";


    Boolean:
	        *It’s used to represents a logical entity and can have only two values: `true` or `false`. 
	        * Example: let isGuviStudent = true;
		               let isNotGuviStudent = false;

    Undefined:
	        *It’s used to represents a variable without a value, has the value undefined. 
             The type is also undefined.
	        * Example: let x; (output is undefined.)

    Null:
	        *It’s used to represents 'null' data type defines a value that represents nothing,
             or empty value.
	        * Example: let car = null;(output is Null.)

    Symbol:
            *It’s a special datatype in ES 6.
	        * It’s used to represents a unique value that is anonymous.
            * That means the privacy of the object.
        Syntax,
	        1)Creating a symbol
              let symbolName = Symbol("description");
            2)Using a symbol
               let obj = {};
               obj[symbolName] = "value";
            *Example:  
                let user = {
                name: "Santhosh",
                age: 22
               };
                let id = Symbol("id");
                user[id] = 101;
                console.log(Object.keys(user));
                console.log(user[id]);   




Non Primitive:
            *Non primitive data types are known as mutable datatypes.
            *Non primitive data types are complex data types that represent a collection of values.
            *Non primitive data types values are changeable ,and also that’s hold a multiple data values like array,objects..,etc
            *They are classified into 4 types,
            *They are,
                *Object
                *Date
                *Array
                *Function

    Object: 
	        *It’s used to represents a collection of data or a complex data structure.
	        *It’s store a key value pairs.
	        *Example:
                 let person = { name: 'Santhosh',degree:'MCA'};
                 person.age = 22;
                 console.log(person);

    Date:
	        *It’s used to represents a point in time.
	        *Example: 
                let today = new Date();
                today.setFullYear(2030);
                console.log(today.getFullYear());

    Array:
	        *It’s used to represents a list or sequence of data.
            *Array index starts from zero.
	        *We can store any data type data in an single array.
            *Example: 
                let fruits = ['apple', 'banana'];
                fruits.push('mango'); 
                console.log(fruits);
                fruits.pop();
                console.log(fruits);


    Functions:
	        * It’s used to represents a reusable block of code.
	        *We can add a method in our function
	        *Example:
		        function add(a, b) {
                return a + b;
                }
                add.desc = "This is a sum function";
                add.multiply = function (a, b) {
                return a * b;
                };
                console.log(add(2, 3));       
                console.log(add.desc);        
                console.log(add.multiply(2,3));
